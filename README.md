This repo contains cheat sheets + data structures & algorithms templates useful for MLE, DS, and SWE interviews. All cheat sheets were created by me and helped me secure multiple offers at big tech companies. If any of these resources prove helpful to you, consider leaving the repo a ‚≠ê!

### Cheat Sheets
- [**A/B Testing**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/ab-testing.pdf): 4 step process to approach "design an experiment" interview questions
- [**Metrics Cases**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/metrics-cases.pdf): Tips for approaching data science metrics/product interviews like "why are friend requests down 10%"
- [**ML Models Code**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/ml-models-code.ipynb): Python implementations of most popular classical ML models (most of the code is from [MLfromScratch](https://github.com/python-engineer/MLfromscratch))
- [**ML Models**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/ml-models.pdf): Important details to know for most popular classical ML models includings pros/cons, assumptions, and formulas
- [**ML System Design**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/ml-system-design.pdf): 4 step process to approach "design a model" interview questions
- [**ML Theory**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/ml-theory.pdf): Important details to know about the general ML modeling process (e.g. cross validation, precision vs recall, etc.)
- [**Statistics**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/statistics.pdf): Basic statistical concepts including probability, hypothesis testing, bayesian vs frequentist etc.
- [**System Design**](https://github.com/edwardleardi/mle-ds-swe-cheat-sheets/blob/main/cheat-sheets/system-design.pdf): 4 step process to approach "design Twitter" type interview questions as well as important system design topics (e.g. load balancers, caching, etc.)
